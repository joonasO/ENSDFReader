191PB cG           |g-ray data are mostly from {+173}Yb({+24}Mg,6n|g)           
191PBxcG (1998Fo02). There is reasonable agreement between this source and      
191PBxcG {+180}W({+16}O,5n|g) (1999La06) regarding the |g-ray energies,         
191PBxcG but there are significant differences with                             
191PBxcG respect to the intensities of |g rays below about 450 keV, reaching    
191PBxcG a factor 3-4 for the lowest energies (see the corresponding datasets). 
191PBxcG Note also that there are a few higher energy transitions (577 and 712  
191PBxcG keV) which also exhibit an intensity ratio exceeding 3 between both    
191PBxcG publications. There is also a systematic shift in the |g-ray           
191PBxcG energies, with those from 1999La06 (which are the more precise values) 
191PBxcG an average of 0.3 {i4} keV above the energies reported by 1998Fo02.    
191PBxcG This difference is of course reflected in the corresponding level      
191PBxcG energies. All these discrepancies cannot be resolved in the            
191PBxcG context of the present evaluation, and would require further           
191PBxcG measurements to clarify the issue.                                     
191PB cG E         The tabulated |g-ray energies are either from 1998Fo02 in    
191PBxcG {+173}Yb({+24}Mg,6n|g), or a weighted average from the data in         
191PBxcG 1998Fo02 and in {+180}W({+16}O,5n|g) (1999La06), whenever              
191PBxcG values from the latter reference were available.

191PB cL           The adopted level scheme follows mostly the one proposed in  
191PBxcL 1998Fo02, and is based on E|g, I|g, |g|g and |g|g|g coincidences, and  
191PBxcL DCO (directional correlation) ratios. Other important contributions    
191PBxcL are the half-life and conversion coefficient measurements from         
191PBxcL 1999La06. While there is reasonable agreement between 1999La06 and     
191PBxcL 1998Fo02 about the band based on the 13/2+ isomeric state, as shown    
191PBxcL in the reaction datasets below, there are                              
191PBxcL significant differences regarding the 15/2+ band. See                  
191PBxcL also the comments preceding the Adopted Gammas table for a discussion  
191PBxcL about disagreements between both papers regarding many |g-ray          
191PBxcL intensities. Furthermore, there is a shift in the level energies of    
191PBxcL 1999La06 with respect to those in common with the level scheme from    
191PBxcL 1998Fo02, due to a systematic offset of about 0.3 keV in the |g-ray    
191PBxcL energies reported in both papers (see comment preceding Adopted        
191PBxcL Gammas table).                                                         
191PB cL E         The level energies are from a least-squares adjustment to    
191PBxcL the adopted |g-ray energies, and are relative to the (13/2+) isomeric  
191PBxcL state, except where noted.                                             
191PB cL E(X)      Level energies are obtained assuming a value of 2512+x keV   
191PBxcL for the band head for Dipole Band 1. The uncertainties in these        
191PBxcL energies do not contain the 5 keV uncertainty in the energy of the     
191PBxcL 2512+x kev band head level (see (HI,xn|g) datasets).                   
191PB cL J(Y)      The J|p value is interpreted by 1998Fo02 as due to the       
191PBxcL coupling of the i13/2 neutron hole to states in the {+192}Pb core.
